:factory: Programming with SAP proprietary programming language ABAP for Business

:wrench: Additionally I enjoy Java / Spring Framework (for backend) as well as JavaScript / Typescript with React.JS (for frontend) to get to know new concepts + ideas for programming and to be able to bring some ideas to life. Currently I am additionally learning Rust to gain some more control over what is happening on the hardware and maybe create some more performant applications + to enhance my programming know-how.

:computer: System Administration with linux for fun
  - setup of own test environments (e.g. own webserver + install created backends as a service)
  - basics of MySQL + postgresql database administration
  - containerization with docker
